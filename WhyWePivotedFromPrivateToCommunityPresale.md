# Why We Pivoted from Private → Community Presale

**We’re switching from a private sale to a community presale to align incentives from day one.** FUZE.ac isn’t a promise—it’s shipping: a Telegram‑native app with verification gates, safer payments that are idempotent by design, quiet‑hour alerts, and clear refund/recourse paths when things go wrong. We’ll build in public, reward healthy participation, and publish reliability signals as modules graduate. Join us at **vesting.fuze.ac**.

## Hook — From Closed Rooms to Open Rails

Crypto doesn’t need another pitch; it needs working rails that ordinary users can trust. After talking with builders, traders, and long‑term holders across our networks, a pattern emerged: private rounds were fast, but they created information asymmetry, unclear obligations, and a lag between capital and product reality. We’re fixing that with a **Community Presale** that runs entirely on‑chain and connects directly to the product it funds.

---

## Setup — What FUZE.ac Is

FUZE.ac is a **utility‑first liquidity & income platform** for token ecosystems. Think of it as the operating system that helps a token behave like a micro‑public company:
- **PlayHub (Token Utility Amplifier):** plug tokens into mini‑apps and games for instant utility and demand. Projects can rent modules and tie real usage to rewards.
- **AI Market Maker (MM):** exchange‑adapter stack across 40+ CEXs/DEXs that manages spreads, depth, unlock absorption, and compliance modes.
- **OTC Deal Engine:** KPI‑bonded escrows and structured deals to prevent dump‑and‑dilute behavior.
- **KPI/Compliance Engine:** monitors venue rules and liquidity health; can clamp spreads or boost volume when needed; emits a public scorecard.
- **Real‑Yield Staking Vault:** quarterly Stablecoin distributions (USDT/USDC) from net profits across PlayHub rake, MM retainers, and OTC fees.

All sensitive actions—identity, payments, claims—flow through **idempotent**, auditable endpoints. Admin & MM actions are logged and hashed to chain for a verifiable, forensic trail.

## Tension — What Wasn’t Working with Private Rounds

Private allocation deals optimized for speed and headline names, not for alignment:
- Off‑chain terms led to inconsistent expectations about unlocks, liquidity support, or product deliverables.
- The buyer spectrum skewed toward short‑term flip dynamics, which amplifies post‑TGE volatility.
- Community members—the people who actually use the product—arrived last and at the worst price, with little transparency into how funds were used.

We wanted the opposite: **first‑class community access, determinism, and day‑one product utility**.

---

## Turn / Insight — The Community Presale

We redesigned our raise around three principles: **fair access, verifiable rules, and live utility.**

1) **Fair Access via Transparent Pricing**  
   Tokens are sold in four clearly published tiers with **automatic blended pricing** if a single purchase crosses a boundary:
   - **Pioneer:** $0.015 (first 15M)
   - **Builder:** $0.025 (next 25M)
   - **Architect:** $0.035 (next 30M)
   - **Vanguard:** $0.045 (final 40M)  
   Target **TGE list price:** $0.055.

2) **Verifiable Rules via Smart Contracts**  
   - Pay with **ETH, USDT, or USDC (valued at $1)**.  
   - The contract calculates the tokens due and **automatically refunds** any overpayment in the same transaction.  
   - Your purchased amount is recorded directly to a **vesting vault** tied to your wallet.

3) **Live Utility from Day One**  
   Presale participants immediately plug into the FUZE flywheel: PlayHub pilots, AI‑MM liquidity alignment, and a referral system that rewards healthy growth (5% / 2% / 1% across three levels for **new** buyers—no self‑referrals).

---

## Proof & Examples — Why These Mechanics Matter

- **Unlock Discipline:** Vesting begins at TGE with **10% unlocked immediately**, a **30‑day cliff**, and the remaining **90% unlocking daily over 200 days**. This smooths supply and reduces incentive to rush exits. You can claim any unlocked portion anytime from the Vesting page.
- **Operational Transparency:** Price feed, contract addresses, and vesting math are visible in‑app; key admin controls are deliberately narrow (e.g., the ability to update price feeds or hit an emergency pause), while all economic rules live in code.
- **Revenue With Accountability:** Net Stablecoin profits from PlayHub rake, market‑making retainers, and OTC fees flow to **stakers quarterly** via an on‑chain vault. Team and advisors stake under the **same** contract—no shadow pools.
- **Breadth of Liquidity:** Exchange adapters cover **40+ CEX/DEX venues**, allowing the AI‑MM to manage spreads and depth consistently as listings expand.
- **Forensic Trail:** Critical actions (admin, MM, payouts) flow into structured logs and are hashed to chain at intervals to create a tamper‑evident audit trail.

In short, **code enforces the promises**—and the product modules that benefit from your participation start working immediately.

## Application — How to Join (3 Minutes)

1) **Connect Wallet** at the presale portal. Supported payments: **ETH / USDT / USDC** on the specified network.  
2) **Enter Amount**. The smart contract calculates tokens and **auto‑refunds** any excess if you cross a tier.  
3) **Confirm**. Your allocation is written to the vesting vault.  
4) **Track & Claim** at TGE: 10% unlocks immediately → 30‑day cliff → daily unlocks over 200 days. Claim any time—accrued amounts batch automatically.  
5) **Refer**. Share your referral link to earn **5% / 2% / 1%** across three levels for **new** participants. Abuse protections (no self‑referrals, sybil checks) keep it fair.

## Counterpoints — What Could Go Wrong (and Our Responses)

- **“Crypto is volatile.”** True. Vesting and adaptive liquidity help smooth shocks, but price will move. We build real utility and real revenues to counter pure speculation.
- **“Referrals can be gamed.”** We prevent self‑referrals, monitor suspicious overlap (e.g., shared payout wallets), and reserve the right to void fraudulent rewards. Leaderboards and delays for risky patterns reduce abuse incentives.
- **“On‑chain UX can be hard.”** The portal abstracts the heavy lifting—idempotent transactions, blended pricing, and refunds happen under the hood. Clear tooltips explain the math before you click.
- **“Will listings create sell‑pressure?”** The unlock profile and AI‑MM coordination aim to keep spreads tight and absorb inventory around catalysts. Our OTC engine provides structured paths for larger flows without harming markets.

---

## Near‑Term Roadmap — 2 to 6 Weeks

- **Verification Gating:** role‑based access and approval trails for investors and partners.
- **Listings + Refund Logic:** codified pathways for reversible actions and recourse.
- **Events Ingestion & Reliability Signals:** public status boards as modules graduate.
- **Rewards Steady‑State:** tiered points, cooldowns, anti‑fraud holds, and clearer summaries for referral earnings.

**Quarter Outlook:** Stars‑settled escrow on Ethereum, fee‑sharing epochs with signed summaries, and governance primitives (“DAO‑lite”) for vetoing anomalous payouts.

---

## Future Outlook — Why This Matters Beyond FUZE

Presales shouldn’t be side‑cars to a pitch deck; they should be **part of the product**. By moving capital formation into the same deterministic rails that power utility, liquidity, and payouts, we can raise with our community, not in spite of it. If we do this right, FUZE becomes the reference implementation for **how a token can behave like a transparent, software‑defined micro‑public company**.

## Closing — Build With Us

The Community Presale is our line in the sand: **no more closed rooms**. If you align with utility over hype and receipts over rhetoric, you’ll feel at home here. Get your allocation, bring your circle via the referral program, and hold us to the standards we’ve set: verifiable rules, real usage, real yield.

**Join us at vesting.fuze.ac — we’ll keep shipping in public.**
